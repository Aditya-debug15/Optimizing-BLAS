## About the project
This project covers the methods i have tried to optimize the code for BLAS. The project is divided into 3 parts:
1. Optimizing the code for BLAS Level 1
2. Optimizing the code for BLAS Level 2
3. Optimizing the code for BLAS Level 3

The various methods involved are:
1. Using different compliers and flags
2. Using parallelization
3. Using vectorization
4. Optimally using the cache
5. Data prefetching

## Report
The report.pdf covers the exact details of the various methods and results obtained. 

## Code
Makefile contains the commands to compile the code.

## Other task
1. The project also include writing code that can work as a benchmark to calculate the performances of other codes. 
2. The project also covers the use of the profiler to find the bottlenecks in the code.

**All the code is writen in C++**
